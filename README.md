# Correlation_03102020
Contains python files to run my analysis on since 03282020

This files are in the following order;
temp_Load_Script.py
fluctuation_Save.py
tp_Correlations_New.py

For each of the files I import BMX to call the finding_Time_Index function. I created a new python script called finding_Time.py that only contains the function I use from BMX.
